# Distance-from-Camera-to-Object-using-single-camera
## using dlib for face Detection and Opencv for image processing

You can use any object you want, inplace of face, 
1. First you have to measure the object width or height/ which you want use.
2. Then you have to measure the distance from camera to object and capture the image, that image will be used as reference image,and distance as well.
